;;; Commentary:

;; Magithub is an interface to GitHub using the `hub' utility [1].
;;
;; Integrated into Magit workflows, Magithub allows very easy, very
;; basic GitHub repository management.  Supported actions include:
;;
;;  - pushing brand-new local repositories up to GitHub
;;  - creating forks of existing repositories
;;  - submitting pull requests upstream
;;  - viewing and creating issues
;;
;; Press `H' in the status buffer to get started -- happy hacking!
;;
;; [1]: https://hub.github.com

;; Requires hub 2.2.8
