* Breaking Changes
- If you were using ~magit-header-line~ to customize the appearance of
  the =Issues= and =Pull Requests= section headers, those now use the
  ~magit-section-heading~ face.  [[PR:196]]
- Many functions related to issue/post creation have been reworked.
  Instead of the widget framework, we now use =magithub-edit-mode=.  See
  more details in 'New Features'.  [[PR:204]]
- =magithub-dashboard-show-unread-notifications= is now called
  =magithub-dashboard-show-read-notifications= and all functionality
  pertaining to that variable has been updated.  [[PR:251]]
- Most settings, like the inclusion of sections in ~magit-status~, are
  now controlled by various =git config= properties.  These settings are
  reachable under =H C=.  The following functions/variables no longer
  exist:
  - ~magithub-ci-enabled-p~ (now ~magithub-settings-include-status-p~)
  - ~magithub-ci--set-enabled~
  - ~magithub-ci-disable~
  - ~magithub-ci-enable~
  - ~magithub-toggle-ci-status-header~
  - =magithub-cache= (now =magithub-settings-cache-behavior-override=;
    ~magithub-settings-cache-behavior~)
  - ~magithub-toggle-online~
  - ~magithub-go-online~
  - ~magithub-go-offline~
  - ~magithub-source--remote~
  - ~magithub--deftoggle~
  - ~magithub-toggle-pull-requests~
  - ~magithub-toggle-issues~
  - ~magithub-proxy-set~
  - ~magithub-proxy-set-default~
  - ~magithub-enable~
  - ~magithub-disable~
  - ~magithub-enabled-toggle~
  - =magithub-enabled-by-default=

  The various integration sections are now added to the appropriate
  hooks by ~magithub-feature-autoinject~ via =magithub-feature-list=.

  For more details on how to set configure Magithub now, consult the
  documentation inside ~magithub-settings-popup~ (=? KEY=) or read
  =magithub-settings.el=.  [[PR:265]]

* New Features
- Browse commits by using =w= on a commit section.  If the current
  section's value cannot be understood as a valid commit, use the
  =git-revision= at point.
- ~magithub-feature-autoinject~ can now take a list of features to load.
- Many symbols are now supported by ~thing-at-point~:
  - =github-user=
  - =github-issue=
  - =github-label=
  - =github-comment=
  - =github-repository=
  - =github-pull-request=
  - =github-notification=
  These symbols should allow other GitHub-sensitive packages to use
  the work Magithub has already done without depending on Magithub
  directly.  [[PR:201]]
- The widget interface for writing issues and pull requests is gone!
  Now, everything uses the framework debuted for writing comments.
  For issues and pull requests, the first line (i.e., everything up to
  the first newline character) is parsed as the title; everything else
  as the body.  Now issues, pull requests, and comments use a common
  interface that supports submitting, canceling, and saving drafts to
  finish later.  [[PR:204]]
- You can now edit comments using =e= on a comment section.  [[PR:206]]
- When submitting pull requests of a single commit, the commit message
  is defaulted into the pull request body.  Multiple commits?
  ~magit-log~ shows you the changes you want to merge.  [[PR:239]]
- Headers in issue-view mode are now easier to navigate.  [[PR:250]]
- Notifications are marked as read when visited in Emacs.  [[PR:252]]
- ~magithub-repo~ can now take a string of the form =user/repo=.  This is
  helpful when writing other code that uses Magithub functionality.  [[PR:253]]
- New command ~magithub-pull-request-new-from-issue~ can create pull
  requests from issues.  This creates a new pull request by copying
  the title/body from the source issue.  (To be honest, this API
  endpoint is not what I thought it would be.)  [[PR:256]]
- Confirmation messages can now be skipped (or the default question
  behavior otherwise altered) using =git config= properties.  See
  ~magithub-confirm-set-default-behavior~ or configure your settings
  locally (or globally) interactively when they're asked.  [[PR:268]]
  [[PR:270]]
- Use default branch of the repository as =BASE= if there's no upstream
  for the current branch.  [[PR:269]]
- Completion of issue numbers ("#123"), and user names ("@purcell") is
  supported in edit and commit message buffers via the standard
  ~completion-at-point~ mechanism, and therefore also via ~company~'s ~capf~
  backend.  This is enabled by default in certain buffers via the
  ~magithub-features~ mechanism.  [[PR:263]], [[PR:278]]

* Bug Fixes
- In ~magithub-repo~, an API request is no longer made when the
  repository context cannot be determined.
- The list of labels is now correctly cached per-repository.  [[PR:203]]
- The full list of labels is now available for use when modifying
  issues and pull requests.  [[PR:203]]
- The cache (and other files in =magithub-dir=) are no longer added to
  the =recentf= list.  [[PR:210]]
- Consistently use ~magithub-request~.  [[PR:229]]
- ~magit-magithub-pull-request-section-map~ is now defined in terms of
  ~magit-magithub-issue-section-map~.  [[PR:238]]
- Fix autoloads to load and install the dispatch with Magit.  [[PR:238]]
- Remove awkward blank lines from the end of the dashboard.  [[PR:238]]
- Issue/PR drafts are deleted appropriately after successful
  submission.  [[PR:247]]
- Various performance improvements.  [[PR:255]]
- Ghub+ is now required in core.  This should help users who utilize
  deferred loading.  [[PR:260]]
- Submitting pull requests to other repositories in some scenarios
  should now be fixed.  [[PR:272]]
- ~magithub-clone~ now correctly provides a default destination.  [[PR:273]]
- ~magithub-pull-request-new~ now uses a better check to test for pull
  requests of a single commit:  [[PR:274]]
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git rev-list --count BASE..
  #+END_SRC
- Authenticate correctly when marking notifications as read.  [[PR:277]]
- Don't call ~magit-get~ in a non-existent directory in ~magithub-clone~.
  [[PR:282]]
- Pull requests now work in repositories with remotes that point to
  non-GitHub locations.  [[PR:285]]
